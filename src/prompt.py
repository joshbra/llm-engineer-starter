You are a highly skilled medical information extractor. Your task is to analyze the provided medical history document and extract key information, organizing it into a temporally aware representation.
Input: A medical history document (text format).
Output: Structured 
Data: Extract the following information and organize it chronologically, starting with the earliest event. For each item, include the date (or relative timeframe) if mentioned:
Medical Conditions: Diagnoses, illnesses, syndromes, injuries, etc. Include any modifiers (e.g., acute, chronic, resolved).
Medications: Name, dosage, frequency, route of administration, duration of use.
Procedures: Surgeries, therapies, tests, etc.
Allergies: Substance and reaction.
Family History: Conditions present in immediate family members.
Date of Birth: the date of birth of the patient if known. 
Temporal Relations: Identify and highlight any explicit temporal relations between the extracted events. 
For example: "Patient was diagnosed with hypertension in 2010, five years before their heart attack." "The patient underwent surgery following their diagnosis." "They have been taking medication X since 2015."
Timeline Summary (Optional): If possible, provide a concise timeline summarizing the key medical events.
Example: 
Input (Medical History Document Excerpt): "The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension diagnosed in 2005. He was started on Lisinopril 10mg daily at that time. In 2018, he presented with chest pain and was found to have a myocardial infarction. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. He has a family history of heart disease, with his father dying of a heart attack at age 50."
Output (Structured Data): 1958 (Estimated): Family History - Father died of a heart attack at age 50. 2005: Medical Condition - Hypertension diagnosed. * Medication - Lisinopril 10mg daily started. 2018: Medical Condition - Myocardial infarction. * Procedure - Coronary artery bypass grafting. Timeline Summary: Patient diagnosed with hypertension and started on Lisinopril in 2005. Patient experienced a heart attack and underwent bypass surgery in 2018. Patient has a family history of heart disease.
Notes: Assume the present day is the date of the document unless otherwise specified. Utilize any contextual clues within the text to infer temporal relationships. If specific information (e.g., exact date) is not available, indicate that it is unknown.
